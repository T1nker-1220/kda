*This lessons-learned file serves as a critical knowledge base for capturing and preventing mistakes. During development, document any reusable solutions, bug fixes, or important patterns using the format: [Version] Category: Issue → Solution → Impact. Entries must be categorized by priority (Critical/Important/Enhancement) and include clear problem statements, solutions, prevention steps, and code examples. Only update upon user request with "lesson" trigger word. Focus on high-impact, reusable lessons that improve code quality, prevent common errors, and establish best practices. Cross-reference with @memories.md for context.*

# Lessons Learned

### Image Handling
[0.0.1] Important - Image Storage Architecture: Issue: Unorganized image storage and URL management in Supabase leading to maintenance difficulties → Solution: Implemented structured storage configuration with dedicated buckets per content type, path generation utilities, and filename preservation system → Why: Proper organization and consistent naming conventions are crucial for long-term maintainability and prevent URL-related bugs.

[0.0.2] Important - Image Upload Management: Issue: Duplicate filenames and inconsistent image handling → Solution: Created robust upload utility with original filename preservation, automatic duplicate detection, and proper error handling → Why: Standardized upload process prevents naming conflicts and ensures reliable image storage.

[0.0.3] Enhancement - Image Optimization: Issue: Lack of image optimization and transformation capabilities → Solution: Integrated Next.js image optimization with custom URL generation utility supporting dynamic transformations → Why: Optimized images improve performance and user experience while maintaining quality.

[0.0.4] Important - Component Accessibility: Issue: Basic component implementation lacking proper accessibility features and user feedback → Solution: Enhanced components with ARIA labels, focus states, helper text, required field indicators, and smooth transitions → Why: Proper accessibility and visual feedback are crucial for usability and compliance with WCAG standards.
