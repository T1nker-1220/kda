# Project Memories (AI & User) ðŸ§ 

### **User Information**
- [0.0.1] User Profile: (NAME) is a beginner web developer focusing on Next.js app router, with good fundamentals and a portfolio at (portfolio-url), emphasizing clean, accessible code and modern UI/UX design principles.

### **Interactions**
- [0.0.2] Development: Verified and enhanced project requirements documentation by adding comprehensive sections for Performance (loading metrics, caching), Security (data protection, rate limiting), SEO (metadata, technical optimization), Accessibility (WCAG compliance, responsive design), and Testing (coverage, types, QA) requirements to ensure complete project specification and maintainable development roadmap. #improvement #documentation

- [0.0.3] Development: Analyzed existing Supabase database structure and determined to keep it due to well-designed schema with proper enums, tables, constraints, and RLS policies, particularly solid authentication setup with role-based access control. #database #analysis

- [0.0.4] Manual Update: Identified image handling issues in previous project: URL management problems and need for original filename preservation in Supabase storage bucket. Decision made to improve image system while maintaining existing database. #image-handling #improvement

- [0.0.5] Development: Designed comprehensive image handling solution including: structured storage organization with clear bucket/path configuration, robust image upload utility with original filename preservation and duplicate handling, client-side image cropping component integration, efficient URL generation utility, and Next.js image optimization configuration. Implementation focuses on maintainability, type safety, and proper error handling. #feature #image-handling #architecture

- [0.0.6] Development: Created detailed project roadmap with 5 phases (Foundation Setup & Authentication, Core Features Implementation, Order System & Payment Integration, User Experience & Optimization, Deployment & Documentation) including timeline estimates, priority levels, and success metrics. Total estimated development time: 6 weeks. #planning #roadmap #project-management

- [0.0.7] Development: Successfully completed Next.js 14.1.0 setup with App Router, including proper TypeScript configuration, ESLint setup, and basic project structure following best practices. Project structure verified with proper src/app directory organization. #setup #infrastructure

- [0.0.8] Development: Created detailed plan for Shadcn/UI implementation, breaking down the configuration into four key subtasks: CLI setup, theme configuration, core components installation (Card, Button, Input, Form), and component organization. Plan focuses on authentication system requirements and maintainable structure. #planning #ui #authentication

- [0.0.9] Development: Revised project state and created detailed plan for TailwindCSS configuration, correcting the implementation sequence to ensure proper styling foundation before proceeding with UI components. Breaking down the setup into installation, PostCSS configuration, global styles, and testing phases. #planning #styling #correction

- [0.0.10] Development: Defined brand color requirements (dark orange primary with dark brown background) and updated TailwindCSS configuration plan to include custom utility classes and global styles for consistent brand identity implementation. Configuration will serve as foundation for all UI components. #planning #styling #branding

- [0.0.11] Development: Implemented TailwindCSS configuration with brand colors (dark orange #FF5722 and dark brown #3E2723), created custom utility classes for buttons, set up global styles with CSS variables, and created a test component to verify the styling system. #implementation #styling #branding

- [0.0.12] Development: Created detailed plan for Shadcn integration, focusing on maintaining brand identity while setting up essential authentication components (Card, Button, Input, Form). Plan includes proper installation command (shadcn@latest), theme configuration, and component testing strategy. #planning #ui #components

- [0.0.13] Development: Successfully installed and configured Shadcn components (Button, Card, Input, Form, Label) with proper brand colors integration. Created comprehensive test page (/test) showcasing all components with various states and styling variants. #implementation #ui #components

- [0.0.14] Development: Enhanced test page with comprehensive accessibility improvements including ARIA labels, focus states, helper text, and required field indicators. Added smooth transitions, hover effects, and visual feedback for better UX. Improved component documentation with descriptive text. #enhancement #accessibility #ux

- [0.0.15] Development: Completed Shadcn/UI setup and documentation. Ready to proceed with authentication implementation.

- [0.0.16] Development: Completed project initialization phase with 100% confidence, verified all components (Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI) are properly configured, confirmed Supabase auth setup with credentials in .env.local, and prepared for authentication implementation with dark mode support requirement. Project structure and foundation are now fully established and ready for Phase 1 - Authentication System implementation. #milestone #completion #authentication

- [0.0.17] Development: Implemented comprehensive authentication system with Supabase, including client configuration, auth context provider, OAuth callback handler, and middleware for protected routes. Set up proper TypeScript types, error handling, and role-based access control. Authentication system now supports Google OAuth with dark mode UI requirement. #feature #authentication #security

- [0.0.18] Development: Clarified authentication UI requirements - confirmed need for loading states and error handling components, but no email verification after OAuth. Updated implementation plan with detailed steps for dark mode support, loading spinner, error pages, and Google OAuth button. Project confidence increased to 100% with all questions answered. #planning #authentication #ui

- [0.0.19] Development: Implemented comprehensive dark mode support and error handling system - created theme provider with system preference detection, theme toggle with accessibility, auth layout with responsive design, loading spinner component, error message component, and error page for authentication failures. All components support dark mode and include proper ARIA labels. #feature #ui #accessibility

- [0.0.20] Development: Clarified login page requirements and enhanced user experience features - confirmed need for loading states during authentication flow, OAuth popup blocking detection, and welcome message after successful login. Updated implementation plan with detailed steps for each feature and increased project confidence to 100%. #planning #authentication #ux

- [0.0.21] Development: Updated login page to use Supabase authentication instead of NextAuth, implementing Google OAuth with proper loading states, popup blocking detection, error handling, and welcome message toast notifications. The implementation follows project requirements for exclusive Google OAuth usage and maintains accessibility standards with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. #feature #authentication #security

- [0.0.22] Development: Enhanced authentication system by adding Toaster component to root layout for notifications, updating middleware for proper role-based access control with Supabase, and improving auth callback route with better error handling, role assignment, and redirects. All changes follow project requirements for exclusive Google OAuth usage and maintain proper security measures. #feature #authentication #security
