*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

   # Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
   Current Task: [Extract task from user input - be specific and detailed]
   Understanding: [List all requirements and constraints identified]
   Questions: [Number each question clearly]
   Confidence: [Calculate as percentage based on unknowns]
   Next Steps: [Bullet point each required action]

Current Task: Storage System Implementation Review
Understanding:
- All storage utilities have been implemented and tested
- File validation and URL generation working correctly
- Error handling system in place with retry mechanism
- Test environment properly configured

Questions:
1. Are there any performance optimizations needed?
2. Should we implement image transformation features?
3. Do we need additional test cases?

Confidence: 100%
- All tests passing
- Error handling verified
- URL generation working
- File validation complete

Next Steps:
1. Document storage system in Phase 1 documentation
2. Plan image optimization features
3. Consider implementing image transformations
4. Review performance metrics
