*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯

Current Task: Implement Authentication UI with Loading States and Error Handling
Understanding:
- Supabase client configuration is complete
- Auth context and middleware are set up
- Types and utilities are in place
- Need to implement login page UI with dark mode
- Loading states and error handling required
- No email verification needed after OAuth

Questions:
âœ… All questions answered:
1. Loading state UI component for auth state changes: Yes
2. Custom error page for authentication failures: Yes
3. Email verification after Google OAuth: No

Confidence: 100%
- Core authentication system implemented
- Protected routes configured
- Role-based access control ready
- Dark mode support prepared
- Clear requirements for UI implementation
- All questions answered

Next Steps:
1. Create auth layout with dark mode support
2. Implement loading spinner component
3. Create error handling components
4. Build login page with Google OAuth button
5. Add loading states to auth flows
6. Create error pages for auth failures
7. Test complete authentication flow
