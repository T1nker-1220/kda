*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯

Current Task: Complete Authentication UI Implementation
Understanding:
- Supabase client configuration is complete
- Auth context and middleware are set up
- Types and utilities are in place
- Need to implement the login page UI with dark mode

Questions:
âœ… Previous questions answered
New questions:
1. Should we implement a loading state UI component for auth state changes?
2. Do we need a custom error page for authentication failures?
3. Should we add email verification after Google OAuth?

Confidence: 97%
- Core authentication system implemented
- Protected routes configured
- Role-based access control ready
- Dark mode support prepared
- Need to complete UI implementation

Next Steps:
1. Create login page with dark mode support
2. Implement loading states
3. Add error handling UI
4. Test authentication flow
5. Document authentication system
