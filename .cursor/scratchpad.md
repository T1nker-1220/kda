*This scratchpad file serves as your active task management tool following strict formatting and update rules. The Mode System is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type (triggered by new feature requests, requiring detailed planning and 95% confidence before agent mode) and Bug Fix Type (triggered by issue reports, requiring root cause analysis). Each mode enforces specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria through Phase Structure, Progress Tracking (using [X], [-], [ ], [!], [?] markers), Task Management (with unique IDs, real-time status updates, timestamps), Phase Transitions (archiving to /docs/phases/), and Integration Requirements (syncing with Mode System state). Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Cross-reference with @memories.md, @lessons-learned.md, and project requirements for comprehensive development tracking.*

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
   Current Task: Image Management System Implementation Planning
   Understanding:
   - Need to implement complete image management system
   - Must follow structured approach for storage organization
   - Requires robust image upload utilities with drag and drop interface
   - Must implement basic image cropping functionality
   - Needs Next.js image optimization with fast loading and caching
   - Requires URL generation system
   - Must maintain type safety and error handling
   - All images must be PNG format
   - Must implement caching strategies
   - Must have proper performance optimization

   Questions: [âœ“ All Answered]
   1. What are the specific image formats and sizes needed for each type? âœ“ PNG format for all types
   2. Should we implement image transformation features beyond cropping? âœ“ No, only basic cropping needed
   3. What are the performance requirements for image loading? âœ“ Fast loading with web optimization
   4. Do we need to implement image caching strategies? âœ“ Yes, caching required
   5. What are the specific UI requirements for the image upload interface? âœ“ Drag and drop interface

   Confidence: 95%
   - All questions answered
   - Clear requirements from project documentation
   - Previous storage system implementation provides foundation
   - Clear understanding of image formats and UI requirements
   - Caching and performance requirements defined

   Next Steps:
   1. Begin with Structured Storage Organization:
      - Define directory structure for products, categories, and variants
      - Set up access patterns and policies
      - Implement path validation for PNG files
      - Configure bucket settings with caching

   2. Subsequent tasks (to be implemented after storage organization):
      - Design image upload utilities with drag-drop
      - Research and implement cropping functionality
      - Configure Next.js image optimization
      - Implement URL generation system
