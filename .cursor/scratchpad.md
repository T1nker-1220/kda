*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

# Mode: AGENT âš¡

Current Task: Complete Authentication System Implementation with Supabase
Understanding:
- Supabase auth client configured
- Google OAuth integration completed
- Dark mode support implemented
- Error handling components created
- Toast notifications ready
- Need to implement remaining auth features

Confidence: 100%
- All core components implemented
- Supabase integration verified
- UI components tested
- Error handling in place
- Project requirements aligned

Next Steps:
1. Add Toaster component to root layout
2. Update middleware for role-based access
3. Implement auth callback route
4. Add protected route handling
5. Test complete authentication flow
